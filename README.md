#Presentation description
This repo contains the code I used to present my work in my recent Internship at Sensor Platforms.
The actual presentation can be viewed at https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22551328/presentation/presents.html#/ It is a very basic usage of the framework.

A huge shoutout to [hakimel][1] for creating [Reveal.js][2]
